AI Copywriting Assistant

Product Brief
This project is an AI-powered copywriting assistant designed to help content creators describe products clearly and efficiently. Many creators, students, and small business sellers struggle with writing accurate and engaging product descriptions, especially when they are unsure how to structure their ideas or are short on time. This tool helps solve that problem by generating ready-to-use marketing copy based on simple user input.
The target users for this project include content creators, students, and small business owners who need quick, flexible written content for social media posts, product listings, or promotions. Instead of starting from a blank page, users can enter a topic, choose a preferred tone, and select the desired length of the content. The AI then generates a piece of copy that matches those requirements.
This approach is effective because it saves time and reduces cognitive effort. With the support of generative AI, users can quickly explore different versions of copy and adjust their input until the result fits their needs. The tool focuses on practical usability rather than complex configuration, making it accessible even for users without professional copywriting experience.

Reflection

AI assistance played a major role throughout the development of this project. Claude helped generate the initial website structure and interface, while ChatGPT guided me through setting up the backend and integrating the AI API. The most challenging part was connecting the frontend to the AI service and debugging repeated errors during deployment. I was unfamiliar with serverless functions and environment variables, which made the process difficult at first. With step-by-step help from AI tools, I was able to identify configuration issues and successfully generate AI-powered content. In a future version of this project, I would improve error handling and add more customization options.
